## Description

A real-time communication platform designed for seamless interaction, bringing people together through structured discussions and private conversations. Users can join predefined channels, participate in real-time messaging, and engage in 1-on-1 chats. With role-based permissions, admins manage channels and moderate messages, while members communicate freely within set guidelines. To enhance the experience, automated summaries provide quick insights, helping users stay updated effortlessly.

## Objective

## Core features

1. Group communication in predefined channels:
